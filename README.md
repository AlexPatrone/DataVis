## Introduction
As the world attempts to reduce carbon emissions as the rapid effects of climate change take hold, it is important for us to understand our current reality in terms of past, present, and future. One of the largest sources of emissions comes from the oldest of humanity's industries: Agriculture. By analyzing and visualizing our modern CO2 emissions resulting from agriculture, we may be able to theorize on areas where emissions can most easily be reduced, as well as what actions are being taken now to reduce these emissions.

## Research Questions


## Dataset
For my project I plan to use the Agri-food CO2 Emission Dataset, as found on Kaggle and created by user Alessandro Lo Bello. This dataset compiles data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), both of which are organizations associated with and operated by the United Nations. The dataset is primarily describes the amount of CO2 emissions produced by different sectors in the agriculture and food industry. The data is historical, with records starting in 1990 and spanning until 2020. This dataset has roughly 7000 lines and 31 columns. Variables include, Area, Year, Emission Types, Population, Total Emission, and Average Temperature.

The Area column contains a list of 236 unique countries and regions which the dataset records emissions for.

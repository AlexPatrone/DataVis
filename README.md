## Introduction
As the world attempts to reduce carbon emissions as the rapid effects of climate change take hold, it is important for us to understand our current reality in terms of past, present, and future. One of the largest sources of emissions comes from the oldest of humanity's industries: Agriculture. By analyzing and visualizing our modern CO2 emissions resulting from agriculture, we may be able to theorize on areas where emissions can most easily be reduced, as well as what actions are being taken now to reduce these emissions.
